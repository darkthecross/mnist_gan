# A simple example of GAN

This is a simple exploration of GAN. It uses the data from mnist hand written
digits to learn how to write a digit of 9.

I found this [repository](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) fucking useful
during implementation.

The network works well and the process is quite impressive:

iter 120:

iter 420:

iter 720:

iter 1020:

iter 1320:
